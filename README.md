# zz - Simplify Python Installations 🐍

`zz` helps solve the common issues faced by students during Python installations, such as multiple installations and package conflicts.

With `zz`, a single version of Python is installed in a specific location on the machine, allowing access without modifying the user’s environment variables.

## Running a Python Script 📜

You can run a Python script by using the `zz` command followed by the script's name (and any potential arguments). This makes it easy and efficient to use Python without hassle.

## Installing Additional Packages 📦

If you need to install additional packages, use the `zz install` command. This will automatically create a virtual environment (venv) and link it to the code editor you have open.

## Getting the Path to the Python Executable 🛠️

You can also use the `zz dir` command to get the path to the Python executable. This is particularly useful if you need to manually set the path in an editor like VSCode.
